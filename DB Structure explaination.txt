The structure of the "StoreMartt" MongoDB database can be inferred as follows:

1) Collections:

customers - stores customer information such as name, email, password, and billing/shipping address
customer_locations - stores information about the different locations where customers can shop at
carts - stores the items that customers have added to their cart
products - stores information about the products available for purchase such as name, description, price, and category
product_categories - stores information about the different categories that products can belong to
orders - stores information about customer orders including items purchased, customer information, and total cost


2) Primary Keys:

Each collection has an _id field that serves as the primary key, which is automatically generated by MongoDB if not provided when a new document is inserted.



3) Foreign Keys:

The carts collection has a customer_id field that references the _id field in the customers collection. This allows us to link the items in the cart to the customer who added them.

The items field in the carts collection contains product_id fields that reference the _id field in the products collection. This allows us to link each item in the cart to the product it represents.

The products collection has a category_id field that references the _id field in the product_categories collection. This allows us to group products by category.



4) Unique Keys:

MongoDB automatically creates a unique index on the _id field for each collection, ensuring that each document in the collection has a unique _id.

The email field in the customers collection is likely to have a unique constraint, to prevent multiple customers from using the same email address to sign up. This can be enforced by creating a unique index on the email field.
